##Edit config file##

####1. EDIT httpd_qgis.conf ####
:This is required because QGIS on windows seems not to work as FastCGI<br/>
  * Locate the following file and open in text editor.<br/>
    `c:\osgeo4w\httpd.d\httpd_qgis.conf`<br/>
  * Change the following lines of code<br/>
```
LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so
to
LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so
```
```
DefaultInitEnv
to
SetEnv
```

####2. CHANGE qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe ####
: This is required because the QGIS WebClient which you will install later, can NOT address *.exe files, although 	the QGIS Server could.<br/>
  * Locate the following file.<br/>
    `c:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\bin\qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe`<br/>
  * Delete the extention of the file so that it looks like the following.<br/>
    `c:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\bin\qgis_mapserv.fcgi`

###QGIS server validation###
: This step will validate the installation of QGIS server.<br/>
  * Type the following URL to your web browser.<br/>
    `http://localhost/qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`
  * If you receive XML formatted information on your browser, this means your QGIS server has been installed correctly.<br/>
  * (OPTIONAL) You will receive a map image by sending `GetMap` request  as URL shown below (if you have a QGIS project on your machine).<br/>
    `http://localhost/qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&SRS=EPSG:31467&REQUEST=GetMap&map=C:/path-to-a-simple-qgis-project.qgs&WIDTH=1000&HEIGHT=800&LAYERS=weg,bach&FORMAT=image/png`
  
###Download and install QGIS WebClient###
####1. What is QGIS WebClient & why do you need it? ####
  * Under construction


####2. Download QGIS WebClient ####
  * Go to the following GitHub site: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client
  * Download the project as ZIP file (there is a link to your right pane).
  * Unzip the file to the following location.
    `c:\OSGeo4W\apache\htdocs`
  * So you now have the QGIS WebClient files in: <br/>
    `c:\OSGeo4W\apache\htdocs\QGIS-Web-Client-master`
####3. Edit config file ####
  * Locate the following file and open in the text editor.
    `C:\OSGeo4W\apache\conf\httpd.conf`
  * Go to the line 324 (approx.), and change the line of code as follows.
```
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:\OSGeo4W/bin/"
to
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:\OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/bin/"
```
####4. Restart Apache ####
  * You need to restart Apache everytime you make changes to the Apache config file.
  * You can do this by:
    `START MENU --> Programs --> OSGeo4W --> Apache`
